# lab1 and other labs to come

Although the repository is titled as lab1, it will be used for the next labs as well. Our files are organized between
state estimator which runs in matlab, simulation which runs in python, and the robot in arduino. We seperate them through
seperate folders to maintain neatness and order. We also seperate some data into the data folder. Currently we have a main.py 
program but it currently does nothing atm and is there for future development as a program to redirect inputs and outputs between
state estimator and simulation and possibly the arduino as well.
